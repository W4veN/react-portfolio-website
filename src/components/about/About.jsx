          and i'm working as Quality Engineer in Fandom. I have almost two years
          of experience, mostly focused on testing ads on worldâ€™s largest fan
          wiki platform Fandom, but also familiar with mobile apps. As a young
          dog owner almost all of my free time is dedicated to him, the rest I
          spend on watching horror movies, playing football and competitive
          video games.
