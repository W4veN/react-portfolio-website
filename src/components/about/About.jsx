        <p> and i'm working as Quality Engineer in Fandom. I have almost two years of experience, mostly focused on testing ads on worldâ€™s
          largest fan wiki platform Fandom, but also familiar with mobile apps. As a young dog owner almost all of
          my free time is dedicated to him, the rest I spend on watching horror movies, playing football and
          competitive video games.</p>
